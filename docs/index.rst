Documentation for *species*
===========================

*species* is a toolkit for atmospheric characterization of directly imaged exoplanets.

.. important::
   Importing the ``species`` package had become slow because of the many classes and functions that were implicitly imported. The initialization of the package has therefore been adjusted. Any functionalities should now be explicitly imported from the modules that they are part of.
